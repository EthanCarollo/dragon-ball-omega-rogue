A small game in Ruby inspired by **Dragon Ball** and developed with **Gosu**.

Basically, it's a turn-based rogue-like, and thereâ€™s not much more to say.
You have a fight every time, and between each fight, you get new bonuses. That's the idea in a nutshell.

This game was created to explore and test various design patterns in object-oriented programming.
